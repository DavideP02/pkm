# 202108281744 Janssen (Johnson & Johnson)

COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19. It is made up of another virus (an adenovirus) that has been modified to contain the gene for making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This is a protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus which it needs to enter the body’s cells.

The adenovirus passes the SARS-CoV-2 gene into the vaccinated person’s cells. The cells can then use the gene to produce the spike protein. The person’s immune system will recognise the spike protein as foreign and produce antibodies and activate T cells (white blood cells) to target it.

Later, if the person comes into contact with SARS-CoV-2 virus, the person’s immune system will recognise the spike protein on the virus and be ready to defend the body against it.

The adenovirus in the vaccine cannot reproduce and does not cause the disease.^[Dal sito dell'[ema](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/covid-19-vaccine-janssen#:~:text=COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Janssen%20works,does%20not%20cause%20the%20disease.)]
